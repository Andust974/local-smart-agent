# AI Domio Way

**Our principle — simple solutions for complex tasks.**

1. **Minimal friction.**  
   One-click installation, works out of the box. Users spend time on their goals, not on setup.

2. **Autonomy.**  
   Everything runs locally. Internet is needed only where it truly makes sense. No hidden cloud dependencies.

3. **Fair Price ↔ Real Value.**  
   Every product must be honest in price and practical in use. We build solutions we would pay for ourselves.

4. **Packaging.**  
   Inside — engineering power. Outside — clear interface, concise documentation, and Domio’s signature style.

5. **Modularity.**  
   One product = one clear job. But they can be combined into an ecosystem.

6. **Market-ready.**  
   Every release is not just code. It’s a DevKit: complete documentation, usage scenarios, and handy examples.

This is the **DNA of AI Domio**: products that are easy to buy, simple to install, and truly useful.
